# WebDevFinal
Our Final Project for WebDev Yaaay!

This a website created for a high school Web Development class at 
the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. It is intended
to make movie recommendations based off of genre, and it implemented
with only basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There are no guarentees that
this website still works after all these years.
